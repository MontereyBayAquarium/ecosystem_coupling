# ecosystem_coupling
This is the GitHub repository for a project led by Monterey Bay Aquarium aimed at understanding coupling between the rocky intertidal and subtidal. 
The analyses and code in this respository support the findings presented in Smith et al. 2024

## Respository structure

* The 'processed' folders contain the datasets derived from the processing scripts that are used in the analyses.
* **analyses:** This folder contains scripts for each figure and analysis conducted in the paper.
* **figures:** This folder contains all of the high-res figures presented in the paper.
